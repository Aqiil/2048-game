# 2048-game
This is a mobile version of the 2048 puzzle game built with React Native using Expo. 

The goal is to slide tiles on a 4Ã—4 grid and combine matching numbers to reach the 2048 tile.

I was inspired to recreate this game after discovering it on the plane during my return flight to London. I was curious to see how easy it would be to develop from scratch and if I could go a step further and build an AI solver to suggest optimal moves.
